# Function 3D Prints
- 90 Degree Female to Male with a Female to Female Extender
- 3/8 bolt on bottom
- Used a nuts/bolts library that had imperial measurement capability
- PLA, fast mode (0.35mm) - Prusa I3 M2S
- I split the model in half in Slic3r, then crazy glue and/or gaffer tape together
- Not pretty, just functional
